# Assignment 2: APIs

This assignment asked me to create a single page microsite using a public REST API. I found a simple to understand Chuck Norris joke api and
created a very simple layout showcasing the embedded Chuck Norris icon, the joke and the date the joke was added to the api database. 
I also included a button to refresh the page so the next joke could populate the container. 

### API used: [Chuck Norris Jokes API](https://api.chucknorris.io/ "Chuck Norris Jokes API")
